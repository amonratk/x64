# How to up running and access to vagrant

## Up

Open your `Git Bash` then go to drive to install Homestead and up it.

```bash
Prawee@THRL-11154 MINGW64 ~
$ cd /d/Homestead
Prawee@THRL-11154 MINGW64 /d/Homestead ((v10.3.1))
$ vagrant up

Vagrant is currently configured to create VirtualBox synced folders with
the `SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate` option enabled. If the Vagrant
guest is not trusted, you may want to disable this option. For more
information on this option, please refer to the VirtualBox manual:

  https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#sharedfolders

This option can be disabled globally with an environment variable:

  VAGRANT_DISABLE_VBOXSYMLINKCREATE=1

or on a per folder basis within the Vagrantfile:

  config.vm.synced_folder '/host/path', '/guest/path', SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate: false

    homestead: shared folder errors, please make sure the guest additions within the
    homestead: virtual machine match the version of VirtualBox you have installed on
    homestead: your host and reload your VM.

## Check global status

```bash
Prawee@THRL-11154 MINGW64 /d/Homestead ((v10.3.1))
$ vagrant global-status
id       name      provider   state   directory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
0443895  homestead virtualbox running D:/Homestead

The above shows information about all known Vagrant environments
on this machine. This data is cached and may not be completely
up-to-date (use "vagrant global-status --prune" to prune invalid
entries). To interact with any of the machines, you can go to that
directory and run Vagrant, or you can use the ID directly with
Vagrant commands from any directory. For example:
"vagrant destroy 1a2b3c4d"
```

## Checking status

```bash
Prawee@THRL-11154 MINGW64 /d/Homestead ((v10.3.1))
$ vagrant status
Current machine states:
homestead                 running (virtualbox)

The VM is running. To stop this VM, you can run `vagrant halt` to
shut it down forcefully, or you can run `vagrant suspend` to simply
suspend the virtual machine. In either case, to restart it again,
simply run `vagrant up`.
```

## Access via SSH

```bash
Prawee@THRL-11154 MINGW64 /d/Homestead ((v10.3.1))
$ vagrant ssh
