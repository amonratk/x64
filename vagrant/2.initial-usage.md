# How to initial vagrant

Open your `CMD`

### Initial first

```bash
C:\Users\prawee> vagrant init
A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
`vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.
```

### Status

```bash
C:\Users\prawee>vagrant status
Current machine states:
default                   not created (virtualbox)
The environment has not yet been created. Run `vagrant up` to
create the environment. If a machine is not created, only the
default provider will be shown. So if a provider is not listed,
then the machine is not created for that environment.
```

### Global status

```bash
C:\Users\prawee>vagrant global-status
id       name   provider state  directory
--------------------------------------------------------------------
There are no active Vagrant environments on this computer! Or,
you haven't destroyed and recreated Vagrant environments that were
started with an older version of Vagrant.
