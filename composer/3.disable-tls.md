# How to disable TLS

## Problem

```bash
[Composer\Exception\NoSslException]
  The openssl extension is required for SSL/TLS protection but is not available. If you can not enable the openssl
   extension, you can disable this error, at your own risk, by setting the 'disable-tls' option to true.
```

## Fixed

```bash
$ composer config -g -- disable-tls true
```

```bash
You are now running Composer with SSL/TLS protection disabled.
```
