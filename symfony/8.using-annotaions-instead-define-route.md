## Install a package

Go to your project first

```bash
$ composer require annotations
```

```bash
Using version ^5.5 for sensio/framework-extra-bundle
./composer.json has been updated
```

## Using

### Disable lucky number route

Change this route on file `config\routes.yaml`

```bash
app_lucky_number:
  path: /lucky/number
  controller: App\Controller\LuckyController::number
```

to

```bash
#app_lucky_number:
#  path: /lucky/number
#  controller: App\Controller\LuckyController::number
```

### Update using annotations on your controller

```bash
class LuckyController
{
    /**
     * @Route("lucky/number")
     */
    public function number()
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

### Looking again

View with your browser localhost:8080/lucky/number
